# TODO

1. Refactor the code base to only have the basic text editor (the tabs manager; slider panel; plugin manager; etc) as the Core. Everything else will be a plugin (file explorer; moving text);
2. Make the plugin system;
3. Add Vim like mobility (plugin);
4. Add real-time multi-editor edition.
