# TODO

- Refactor the code base to only have the basic text editor as the Core. Everything else will be a plugin (file explorer; moving text);
  
  - Core Text Editor:
    - ExtensionSystem.
    - Side Menu Slider Panels (Left and Bottom).
    - TabSystem.
    - Inline dropdown menu (for intelisence, snippets, etc.). Maybe it will also be a plugin.
    - Context Menu (on mouse hover/enter).
    - PopUps.

  - Built-in Extensions:
    - File Explorer.
    - Find and Replace.
    - Terminal.
    - IntelliSence.
    - Vim commands.
    - DarkTheme/LightTheme.
